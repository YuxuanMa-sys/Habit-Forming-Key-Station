# Habit Forming Key Station

# Problem

People have a difficult time building habits. Specifically, a common issue that many have is losing or misplacing their keys/wallet whenever they enter their place of residence. If they were accustomed to placing and grabbing their keys from a specific designated location, then the likelihood of losing their keys and wallet would be significantly low.

# Solution

Our solution utilizes negative reinforcement to build positive habits for its users. We will build a designated station for placing oneâ€™s keys, or any small item of their choosing, when entering or leaving their home. It will begin detecting the proximity of the keys a few minutes after the keys have initially been removed from the dish, indicating the resident is not home. Once the resident returns home with the keys, a sensor should detect its presence with an RFID tag and continue ringing an alarm through a speaker until the keys are placed correctly. There will be a pressure sensor at the bottom of the dish that will indicate whether the keys have been put into the device. Our solution will have 5 subsystems: proximity detection, control and processing, alarm, confirmation, and power.
